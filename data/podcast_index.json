      "title": "Sonke Ahrens: Building a Thinking System One Note at a Time",
      "summary": "Sonkhe Ahrens outlines how traditional education systems fail to cultivate thinking by rewarding memorization over insight and structure over discovery. Drawing from Luhmann’s Zettelkasten method, Ahrens explains how idea generation emerges from writing permanent notes, forming bottom-up connections, and embracing workflow over rigid planning. The conversation explores the role of bi-directional linking, the fallacy of passive information capture, and how contextual tagging must align with future use cases. Insight, Ahrens argues, cannot be forced—it must emerge from a system that balances deliberate structure with the freedom to connect ideas dynamically across time.",
